# üß† AI Mental Health Assistant for Lebanon



> **Note:** This project was developed as a proof-of-concept during a 12-hour hackathon. Its purpose is to showcase the potential of AI in mental health assessment. It is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical or psychological advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

### üåü Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered mental health assessment chatbot** designed to provide an accessible and private space for individuals to express their thoughts and feelings. Built during a fast-paced hackathon, the application leverages the power of **Llama 3**, released the very same week, combined with an agent-based architecture to conduct an interactive, voice-driven mental health assessment.

A key feature is its **localization to the Lebanese context**. The system was trained with insights from Lebanese psychiatrists and psychologists to better understand and address the specific nuances and cultural factors related to mental health in the region.

### üöÄ Key Features

* **Interactive Chatbot:** Engages users in a supportive and conversational dialogue to assess their mental state.
* **Voice & Text Input:** Users can communicate with the chatbot using either speech or text, offering a flexible and natural interaction experience.
* **Intelligent Agent System:** Utilizes a **CrewAI** framework to create specialized agents:
    * **Follow-Up Questioner:** An agent that analyzes user responses and generates targeted, insightful follow-up questions to gather deeper context.
    * **Mental Health Classifier:** An agent that assesses the user's overall responses and provides a supportive summary, along with relevant mental health resources in Lebanon if significant concerns are identified.
* **Real-time Assessment:** The system provides on-the-spot feedback, offering an immediate and private way for users to gain initial insights into their well-being.
* **Llama 3 Integration:** Implements the then-recently-released Llama 3 model to power the conversational logic and assessment capabilities.

### üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The application operates in a conversational loop:

1.  **Greeting:** The chatbot greets the user and asks an initial question.
2.  **Input:** The user responds via voice, which is converted to text using the `speech_recognition` library.
3.  **Analysis (Agent 1):** The `Follow-Up Questioner` agent analyzes the user's response and generates a new, context-aware question.
4.  **Output (Agent 2):** The new question is converted to speech using `pyttsx3` and played back to the user.
5.  **Final Assessment:** After a series of questions, the `Mental Health Classifier` agent analyzes the entire conversation transcript and provides a final, supportive message. This message can also include suggestions for local Lebanese mental health NGOs if needed.
